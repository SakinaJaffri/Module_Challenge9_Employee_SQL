## Overview

This project comprises three key components: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis. The goal is to design an employee database, create the necessary tables, import data, and perform insightful queries.

## Data Modeling

- Inspect CSV files and sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) using QuickDBD or similar tools.

## Data Engineering

- Create table schemas for six CSV files, specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.
- Ensure tables are created in the correct order to handle foreign keys.
- Import each CSV file into its respective SQL table.

## Data Analysis

   - Retrieve employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary for each employee.

2. **Employees Hired in 1986:**
